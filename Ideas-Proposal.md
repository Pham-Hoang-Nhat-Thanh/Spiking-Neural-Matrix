# Spiking Neural Matrix: A Self Organizing Spiking Neural Network for Energy Efficient, Task Optimized Computation

## 1. Introduction

This proposal outlines a novel spiking neural network (SNN) that self-organizes its connectivity and learning parameters to achieve optimal task performance while maintaining highly sparse, energy-efficient activity. Inspired by biological principles, this network emphasizes correct, timely responses with minimal energy expenditure. Each synapse is equipped with both a weight and an adaptive connection probability, reflecting its “favorability” for the task. The network employs a dual-phase learning strategy—an exploration phase using local spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and a reflection phase that uses feedback-based moderation. Additionally, prospective coding enables neurons to “look ahead” and preemptively correct errors, ensuring robust real-time performance.

## 2. Network Architecture

### 2.1. Input Layer

- **Function:** Transforms real-valued sensory data into an initial spiking representation.
- **Mechanism:** Neurons receive externally injected potentials that directly encode the input features (without synaptic weighting).
- **Output:** Generates a pattern of activation that serves as the initial driving signal for the network.

### 2.2. Hidden Layer

- **Structure:** A fully interconnected layer where each neuron connects to every other neuron, including self-connections.
- **Synaptic Parameters:**
  - **Weights:** Define the influence strength from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons.
  - **Connection Probabilities:** Each synapse carries an adaptive probability indicating its favorability for the task. These probabilities are continuously adjusted through learning, maintaining only the most effective connections.
- **Activity:** Neurons operate in a highly sparse manner, firing only when their activation is necessary—crucial for energy efficiency.

### 2.3. Output Layer

- **Function:** Encodes the network’s decision or response as a binary sequence.
- **Mapping:**
  - Each output neuron is assigned a specific time slot.
  - A spike (1) or its absence (0) within that window determines the output bit.
  - For tasks requiring longer output sequences than the number of output neurons, a cyclic mapping is employed.
- **Evaluation Window:**
  - Output neurons are given a short waiting window during which they must fire at least once (for a desired “1”) or remain silent (for a “0”).
  - Post window, activity is evaluated, and discrepancies trigger moderation signals to correct upstream activity.

## 3. Learning Mechanism

### 3.1. Dual Phase Learning

#### Exploration Phase (Forward Pass)

- **Rapid Local Updates:** Neurons update synaptic weights based on STDP, capturing precise temporal correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes.


#### Reflection Phase (Feedback and Moderation)

- **Output Evaluation:** At predetermined waiting windows, each output neuron is checked against its desired binary output.
- **Moderation Signals:** If an output neuron fails to meet its target, it generates a feedback signal that propagates to presynaptic neurons. This signal, modulated by current synaptic weights (updated by STDP), provides up-to-date error information.
- **Local Error and Learning Rule:** Adjustments occur locally based on the moderation signals, updating both connection probabilities and weights to minimize a global energy-based cost function.

## 4. Encoding Method and Task Output

- **Binary Encoding:**
  - Real-valued inputs are converted into binary spike patterns.
  - Each output neuron is evaluated over a short window; at least one spike represents a “1,” while silence represents a “0.”
- **Parallel Evaluation:**
  - The output sequence is divided into segments corresponding to groups of output neurons for parallel evaluation.
  - For longer sequences, evaluation loops cyclically across the available output neurons.
- **Error Correction:**
  - At the end of each evaluation window, moderation signals are generated for neurons that did not achieve the target output, triggering upstream adjustments in connection probabilities and weights.

## 5. Expected Outcomes

- **Energy Efficiency:**  
  The network's design promotes sparsity in neuron firing, significantly reducing energy consumption—a primary objective in both biological and computational systems.

- **Task Optimization:**  
  Dual-phase learning coupled with prospective error correction allows the network to self-organize and develop optimal connectivity patterns (both weights and connection probabilities) tailored for specific tasks.

- **Real-Time Adaptation:**  
  Prospective coding enables the network to anticipate and correct errors on the fly, resulting in more stable and rapid learning.

- **Flexibility:**  
  The dynamic adjustment of connection probabilities allows continuous optimization for varying tasks without being limited by a fixed architecture.

## 6. Conclusion

This proposal presents a novel spiking neural network that achieves efficient, task-optimized computation through self-organized connectivity and dual-phase learning. By integrating prospective coding and local error minimization, the network dynamically adjusts its synaptic weights and connection probabilities to minimize a global energy-based cost function. The result is a system capable of accurate task performance with highly sparse activity, ensuring both energy efficiency and robust real-time adaptation.

This framework provides a compelling approach to both understanding and implementing biologically plausible, energy-efficient neural computation.
